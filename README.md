# Basic Data Structures: LISTS





## Before runing the code:

1. Find the **R** PATH using: **R RHOME**
3. Start Jupyter. If you have problems runing **%load_ext rpy2.ipython** locally (not in Colab), set the path like this:
   
import os

os.environ['R_HOME'] = '_write the path you got in step 1_'

**You can see the notebook [here](https://pythonversusr.github.io/basicDataStructures_lists/)**
